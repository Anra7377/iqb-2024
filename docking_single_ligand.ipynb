    "Molecular docking is a kind of calculation used to determine binding modes of small molecules to protein targets. It is commonly used in fields such as drug development to design molecules to bind to enzymes or proteins for a therapeutic effect.\n",

    "When a molecular docking calculation is performed, the docking software samples possible confirmations of a ligand in a target binding pocket. As these configurations are sampled, a score is calculated for each pose. There are many potential ways that poses might be scored, with the development of more accurate scoring functions being an area of active research and development. Types of scoring functions include physics based scoring functions (most often based on molecular forcefields), empirical scoring functions, machine learning scoring functions, etc. For a recent review of docking scoring functions, you can see [this publication](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/S12539-019-00327-W)\n",

You can read more in the [original publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3041641/), or in the [Vinardo paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4865195/)\n",
